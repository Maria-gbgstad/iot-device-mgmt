## Dependencies 
# Storage
When the service is started data will be loaded from configuration files and stored in a database. If `POSTGRES_HOST` is set, postgreSql will be use. If not, sqlite is used instead.
# Watchdog
Watchdog is a feature that will periodically verify the sensors. Currently only last observed time is checked. If larger than `interval` a warning status will be set. 

# Security
## Authorization
Authorization is handled via OIDC access tokens that are delegated to [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) for validation and decoding. This service does not impose any restrictions on the structure of a token's claims, allowing freedom for policy writers to integrate with existing organisational policies more easily.

The only requirement is that the policy evaluation result is an object that contains a list of the tenants that the client is allowed to access. This list can be fetched from an arbitrary claim in the access token or created in the policy file based on other properties such as groups or subject identity (sub).

A [basic policy file](./assets/config/authz.rego) is included in the built image by default, but is expected to be replaced with an organisational specific policy at the time of deployment.

# Configuration

## Environment variables
```json
"RABBITMQ_HOST": "<rabbit mq hostname>"
"RABBITMQ_PORT": "5672"
"RABBITMQ_VHOST": "/"
"RABBITMQ_USER": "user"
"RABBITMQ_PASS": "bitnami"
"RABBITMQ_DISABLED": "false"
"SERVICE_PORT": "<8080>",
"POSTGRES_HOST": "url to postgreSql database"
```
## CLI flags
 - `devices` - A directory containing data of known devices (devices.csv) & sensorTypes (sensorTypes.csv)
 - `policies` - An authorization policy file
 - `notifications` - Configuration file for notifications via cloud events

## Configuration files
First row of csv-files contains headers.
### devices.csv
```
devEUI;internalID;lat;lon;where;types;sensorType;name;description;active;tenant;interval;source
a81758fffe06bfa3;intern-a81758fffe06bfa3;62.39160;17.30723;water;urn:oma:lwm2m:ext:3303,urn:oma:lwm2m:ext:3302,urn:oma:lwm2m:ext:3301;elsys;name-a81758fffe06bfa3;desc-a81758fffe06bfa3;true;default;0;origin
```
 - `devEUI` - id of physical sensor
 - `internalID` - internal id that will be used within the diwise plattform
 - `lat` - latitude 
 - `lon` - longitude
 - `where` - environment
 - `types` - measurement types that will be converted from the sensor payload
 - `sensorType` - name of decoder that the sensor will use 
 - `name` - display name of sensor
 - `description` - description
 - `active` - if set to false measurements will not be delivered
 - `tenant` - name of tenant 
 - `interval` - overrides interval set in sensorTypes
 - `source` - name of the source

### notifications.yaml
Configuration if a [cloud event](https://cloudevents.io/) should be sent to the configured endpoint.
```yaml
notifications:
  - id: qalcosonic
    name: Qalcosonic W1 StatusCodes
    type: diwise.statusmessage
    subscribers:
    - endpoint: http://endpoint/api/cloudevents
```
